I'm a high school student, gamer, writer, and diehard Nintendo fan who loves to program. I mostly work on PHP, Java, and Javascript-related projects, but I'm also experienced with Linux and Ubuntu. I'm an active contributor to the SCP Foundation - securing, containing, and protecting anomalies, and founder of the Ponjo Development Team.
