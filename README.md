I'm a high school student, gamer, writer, and diehard Nintendo fan who loves to program. I mostly work on PHP, Java, and Javascript-related projects, but I'm also experienced with Linux and Ubuntu. I'm an active contributor to the SCP Foundation - securing, containing, and protecting anomalies. If you'd like to learn more about me, check out my [portfolio](https://eerie.codes). I'm currently doing commissions, so if you're interested in contacting me, find my information [here](https://ponjo.club).
